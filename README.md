MVC4 .NET paractice

As indicated, this is merely a demo of the MVC4 that microsoft provides
on their website. The gist of this is pertaining to a student enrollment
system that provide a record of enrollment and current grades (if set). The
majority is JavaScript and C# with a sprinkle of HTML, but the main emphasis
is on the Entity Framework that allows for simpler DB info handling.
